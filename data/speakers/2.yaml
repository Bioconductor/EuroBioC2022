text: "Michael Dorrity has a PhD in Biology from the University of Washington (UW), Seattle. He did postdoctoral research with Cole Trapnell in the Department of Genome Sciences at UW,  applying single-cell genomic and statistical approaches to dissect the effects of temperature in individual developing zebrafish embryos. He joined EMBL in Heidelberg as Group leader in January 2022, aiming to  understand mechanisms of developmental robustness in the face of a changing environment using modern single-cell technologies and computational methods. https://www.embl.org/groups/dorrity/, https://twitter.com/mwdorr"
