text: "Gioele La Manno earned his PhD at Karolinska Institutet, working with Sten Linnarsson. Trained in biotechnology and biomedicine, his research now encompasses molecular biology, computational biology and bioinformatics, and focuses on understanding brain development. He is particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons. He has been tackling this question using machine learning tools on the wealth of data provided by single cell RNA sequencing, a technique he has been working with and developing since its early times. https://gioelelamanno.com/people/gioelelamanno/, https://twitter.com/GioeleLaManno"
