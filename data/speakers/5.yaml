text: "Gioele La Manno earned his PhD at Karolinska Instituet, the Linnarsson Lab. His original training is in Biotechnology and Biomedicine but nowadays he works as Molecular Biologist, Computational Biologist or Bioinformatician. His research focuses on understanding brain development. He is particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons. He have been tackling this question using machine learning tools on the wealth of data provided by single cell RNA sequencing, a technique he have been working with and developing since its early times. https://gioelelamanno.com/people/gioelelamanno/, https://twitter.com/GioeleLaManno"
