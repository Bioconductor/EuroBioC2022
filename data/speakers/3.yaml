text: "The Zaugg Group investigates the variation of molecular phenotypes among individuals along with their genetic and epigenetic variation with the aim of better understanding the molecular basis of complex genetic diseases and inter-individual differences in drug response. We are applying and developing computational biology tools for integrating large-scale biological â€˜omics data to address questions in personalised genomics and investigate basic gene regulatory mechanisms. https://www.zaugg.embl.de/, https://twitter.com/zauggj"
