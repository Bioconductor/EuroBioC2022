text: "Dr. Zaugg is a group leader at EMBL, where she investigates the variation of molecular phenotypes among individuals along with their genetic and epigenetic variation with the aim of better understanding the molecular basis of complex genetic diseases and inter-individual differences in drug response. She applies and develops computational biology tools for integrating large-scale biological â€˜omics data to address questions in personalised genomics and investigate basic gene regulatory mechanisms. Dr. Zaugg obtained her undergraduate training in systems biology at the ETH Zurich and her PhD at the University of Cambridge / EMBL-EBI on computational biology of epigenetics and nuclear organization. She did postdoctoral research with Mike Snyder at the Department of Genetics at Stanford University. https://www.zaugg.embl.de/, https://twitter.com/zauggj"
