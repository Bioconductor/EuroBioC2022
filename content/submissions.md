<!--
### Long workshop

### Birds-of-a-feather session
Free-format, organizer-lead interactive discussion session on a topic relevant to the Bioconductor community.

### Contributed session
Dedicated session consisting of 2-3 talks (10-15 min each) and a 10-15 min discussion by the session chair(s). To propose a contributed session, all the intended talks must be submitted separately by the respective presenter (as regular short talk submissions) to OpenReview, and in addition a proposal for the contributed session must be submitted by the session chair(s), providing a brief description and listing the talks that would take part in the session.
